# Supermind
 Classic colour code-breaking game.

# Work In Progress

**Game is not ready, I'm still working on it!**

# The game

The player, as the codebreaker, tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within a set number of rounds. 
Each guess is made by placing a row of coloured tags on the decoding board. 
Once placed, the script, as the code maker, provides feedback by placing  coloured tags in front of the row with the guess. 
A black key tag is placed for each code tag from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key tag
indicates the existence of a correct color code tag placed in the wrong position.

If there are duplicate colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key tag unless they correspond to the same 
number of duplicate colours in the hidden code.

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker 
guesses correctly, or all rows of the decoding boards are full.
